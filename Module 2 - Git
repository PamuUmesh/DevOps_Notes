Version Control?
Version control is a system that documents changes made to a file or a set of files.It allows multiple users to manage multiple revisions of the same
unit of information. it is a snapshot of your project over time.

Version Control Types:- 

Local Version Control (LVC)

Centralized Version Control(CVC) :- SVN, clearcase, BAZAAR, cmsyn

CENTRAL SERVER = Checkout - file -1

CENTRAL SERVER = Checkout - file -2

Issue:- In case of central server failure whole system goes down

Solution:- Distribution Version Control

Distribution Version Control := metadata records of changes

Remote Server = checkout - file = Version database

Remote Server = checkout - file = Version database

Version database is stored at every users local system& at the remote server.
User manipulate the local file

WHY Git???

Git is most popular control system.
Git Lab, Git hub
Use by all the organations world wide.

Why Git is a clear winner???

Snapshots = git records changes made to a file rather than file itself that means if a file isn't chnaged it isn't stored again.

Fast Operations = Every user has his own copy of the repository data stored locally allowing full functionality even on disconnection.

Distributed = Check-sum before storing any users that you can't any changes to anything without git recording that change.
